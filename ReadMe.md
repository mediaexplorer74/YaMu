![logo](Images/ya-mu.png)

My (lost in 2021) strange YaMu project. This is planned as very lite edition of YandexMusic client (with only 1 function: search&play song "item").


## Abstract
At now this thing allows you to get some music analytics music through Yandex integration in the simplest uwp app for Windows 10 / 11.

## Screensho(s)
